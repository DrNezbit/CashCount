This is a rewrite of my https://github.com/DrNezbit/CashCount-CLI

Originally designed to help count a register, safe, or any other situation where counting the number of coins/rolls/bills/bundles is more efficient then totalling each with a calculator.

This version is upgraded to include a GUI.  Simply pressing the "enter" key changes focus vertically and retotals entries. Totals update on focus change.  Modeled after the count out screen built into most PoS systems, this is designed to be ran on a phone (with PyDroid 3 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.iiec.pydroid3 ) to have a mobile version if PoS system is not available.
